# Overview 
Taxi cabs in urban areas have been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on some important metrics namely average travel speed of taxis and demand for taxi cabs in Chicago, US. For this purpose, we employ Intervention Analysis with the data from some publicly available datasets including Chicago Taxi Trips. we also visualize the relationship between some COVID-19 related variables and change in demand for taxi cabs before and after pandemic in different urban districts. The results show that COVID-19 has a significant impact on the average travel speed of taxis and demand for taxi cabs. 
# Introduction
COVID-19 pandemic has affected our lives in different ways. Specifically, due to the severe enacted restrictions, urban transportation has experienced a significant impact by the pandemic. Lockdown regulations have limited the mobility of citizens and health considerations have changed the transportation-related behavior of the public. Therefore, it is of great importance for transportation planners and decision-makers to identify the changes in transportation metrics caused by the pandemic to make proper decisions based on the new situation. It has also attracted scholars to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on transportation. By analyzing the travel records in Mainland, China, Huang et al. indicated the significant impact of COVID-19 on urban travels [ ]. Arellana et al. studied the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air transport, freight transport, and urban transport. They showed that demand for motorized trips across the cities has decreased on local and nationwide scales [ ]. The pandemic has also influenced the travel mode choice. Duby et al. indicated that people have been using public transport less frequently during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to a normal period as they find it difficult to observe the social distancing on public transports [ ]. 
Taxi cabs as a major transport system in urban areas have been heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic [ ]. The availability of data in some capital cities in the world enables us to investigate the impact of the pandemic on different metrics of taxi services such as demand and travel times in urban areas. It is also important to study the relationship between the transportation metrics and different COVID-19 related variables including active case rate, phase of recovery, etc. 
In this study, first, we aim to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on some important metrics namely average speed and taxi cab demand. To this purpose, we accomplish an Intervention Analysis on the time series (also known as Interrupted Time Series Analysis) derived from the historical data. By employing Intervention Analysis, we try to investigate whether the appearance of a condition or policy (i.e., COVID-19 and its related regulations and policies) has affected a variable (e.g., average travel speed of taxis) in time. Second, we try to see if there is a relationship between some COVID-19 related variables (i.e., active case rate and also COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI)) and change in demand for taxi cabs before and after pandemic in different urban districts (community areas in our case). 
# Questions
In this study we try to address the following questions:
1-	Has the demand for taxi cabs significantly changed after the start of the pandemic? 
2-	Has the pandemic impacted the travel time in Chicago? 
3-	Chicago has 77 community areas and each community area has a different active case rate and COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Is there a relationship between these variables and the change in the demand for taxi cabs?
